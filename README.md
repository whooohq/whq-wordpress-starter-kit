## Quick Docs: How to start & develop with this kit

Beside the [official WordPress developer resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/), this is what you should know to begin:

* Download this repository (don't clone it). Download it using the button: Code -> Download Zip. Use this files in your new project.
* Picostrap already included auto-compilation for it's SCSS files and a live-reload feature built in. You don't need to install anything extra.
* Use the /includes/ folder (inside the child-theme) for any custom PHP code your theme requieres. Don't forget to add your include in the array inside functions.php file. And please, don't just throw every code snippet inside the functions.php. Keep order.
* Use the /sass/ folder (inside the child-theme) to host your SCSS. Don't use simple and plain CSS. Don't touch the style.css (main or child theme). Always use SCSS (Sassy CSS, not SASS) inside the existing folder structure. You can add and import as many SCSS files as you need, for order.
* Remember to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) classes and utilities. Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Use the /js/ folder (inside the child-theme) to host your Javascript. [Enqueue your JS files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/) properly from within your theme. You can add and enqueue as many JS files as you need, for order and logic separation.
* Use the /images/ folder (inside the child-theme) to host your images.
* Use the /fonts/ folder (inside the child-theme) to host your custom fonts.
* If you need to add custom functionality for the site you are building, that better fit into a plugin (see [why you shouldn't put every functionality inside your theme](https://wpmudev.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-functions-php/)), then use the custom plugin included: **whq-custom-functionality** (based on [wppb](https://wppb.me/)).
* Use your local dev enviroment to develop your new site. If you don't have a local dev enviroment, we recommend [Local WP](https://localwp.com/).
* Configure your local WordPress instance with [WP_DEBUG enabled](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/setting-up-a-development-environment/#wp_debug).
* Update any development plugin included. Then enable the ones you want to use during development.
* Start coding.

## Rules and Guidelines
* Code and comment in english. The site itself (front-end) could be targeted to spanish, portuguese or english speakers, that's fine. But your code and comments must always be written in english, so anyone from any country can understand and work over your code too.
* You must follow [WordPress codings standars](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/). That's why we include the .editorconfig file. Use it. There's support for it on many code editors and IDEs. [Check it out](https://editorconfig.org/). Make your code editor or IDE honor the included [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) rules included in this kit.
* You must use the included theme, [Picostrap](https://picostrap.com/). **Use the [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)** for your modifications. **Don't edit the main theme** nor add or remove files from it. Don't touch the main theme folder. Your work must be done inside the [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/).
* You can't add third party plugins **withous asking us first**. Any third party plugin not included in this repository must be approved by us first. This is mandatory. Failure to follow this rule will result on your work to be rejected by us.
* If you need to generate a form for the site (any purpose), you must use the included plugin for it. No other contact form plugin is allowed.
* You must use [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) (SCSS, not SASS) for your CSS, and [Bootstrap 4 o 5](https://getbootstrap.com/). Theme already include Bootstrap v4 (and soon it will include v5). Don't use plain CSS.
* If you need to generate [post metaboxes](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/adding-fields-posts/), an [Options Page](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/options-page/) or [Gutenberg Blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/), use the included plugin Advanced Custom Fields Pro.
* If you use Advanced Custom Fields Pro, then enable [Local JSON caching](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/local-json/).
* If you use Advanced Custom Fields Pro, and don't need to query ACF meta data with WP_Query/meta_query, then enable ACF Extended plugin and enable his [Single Meta Save feature](https://www.acf-extended.com/features/modules/single-meta-save). If you are only using ACF data inside a loop or a single post, don't use advanced meta_query queries referencing ACF data, and use ACF repeaters extensibly, then enabling this feature it's mandatory. If you need to use ACF data with WP queries, then enable [Single Meta Save feature](https://www.acf-extended.com/features/modules/single-meta-save) only in those areas (post types, options pages) than aren't needed for meta queries and/or mark those fields needed for queries as "Save as Individual Meta".
* Use the proper WP's functions and methods to work in a theme or plugin. Again, [WordPress codings standars](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) are a must. So you need to know the [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/), use the proper calls to [include styles and scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/) in your theme, know [the loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/), use [get_stylesheet_directory_uri()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory_uri/) to call the proper URL to include an image, etc. If WordPress provides a way to work with something, doing that "something" in a non-WordPress way is not ok.
* Test your theme with the recommended [WordPress unit test](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test). Download the sample [XML with data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WPTT/theme-unit-test/master/themeunittestdata.wordpress.xml), and import it into your WordPress development instance using WordPress default importer inside the wp-admin: Tools -> Import -> WordPress. Check the "Download and import file attachments" before importing. Make sure your theme looks correct with simple pages, posts, etc.
* It's ok to copy snippets and solutions from the internet. But please: keep in mind the license of the code you're copying. When pasting a snippet, make sure to format it to use WP's coding standards. Don't mix code indentention. Using .editorconfig is for that. The use of [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) ([2](https://gist.github.com/nunomorgadinho/b2d8e5b8f5fec5b0ed946b24fa288a91)) will certainly help, and better if you can setup your code editor to do it automatically for your. Correctly [prefix every function](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/best-practices/#prefix-everything) you copy with a unique prefix for the project, don't keep the name copied from the internet as is.
* Don't make a mess with your code. This will help others and the future you to maintain the project easily. Use PHP includes and separate segments of code according to their functionality. Don't throw every snippet in the functions.php file an make a one big mess inside. Don't make a gigantic unique SCSS or JS file that no-one can understand after. Use SCSS imports. Use SCSS variables for colors and for nested selectors as a bare minimum if you're new to it. Use multiple enqueued JS for different functionalities.
* Don't hard-code URLs in your theme or plugins. Ever. Don't forget that WP provides [wp_add_inline_script](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_add_inline_script/) to expose global variables for use inside your Javascript.

## To Production
* Delete any unused installed plugin or theme. Don't delete the main Picostrap theme; his child theme depend on it.
* Delete any post or page not in use. Don't forget to delete data (posts, pages, attachments) imported with the WordPress unit test XML.
* Disable and delete any development plugin installed.
* Disable WP_DEBUG in your wp-config.php
* Don't forget to change any email (sender/"from" and recipient/"to" addresses) in your forms and WooCommerce if was used. Recipient should be pointing to the correct client's email address.
* Check that the emails are properly configured. Use [Stop WP Emails Going to Spam](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-wp-emails-going-to-spam/) to set the correct email address for the email sent from WP (anything@thefinaldomain.tld), and make sure the correct SPF records exists and are valid for the final domain/server. Send a test email with [Check & Log Email](https://wordpress.org/plugins/check-email/) to verify everything is set up correctly.
* Create a different administrator user for the final client. Don't give the client the same user as the Agency is using.
* Done.
